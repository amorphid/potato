# Potato

Potato is an HTTP Server written in Elixir.  Why is it called potato? Because...  um...  I stared it on a Friday night, I'm fried, anything fried goes with ketchup, I'm about to put ketchup on my hash browns, and my hash browns used to be a potato (probably many potatoes, but Potatoes is a dumb name for an HTTP server).
